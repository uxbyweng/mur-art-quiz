# Quiz App – Frontend Project

This project is a progressively developed frontend quiz application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on clean structure, accessible markup, and incremental enhancement through interactivity and dynamic content.

The app was developed in two stages: first establishing a solid layout and component structure, then extending it with JavaScript-driven behavior and user input handling.

## Project Overview

The Quiz App consists of four main pages:

-   **Home** – Displays all quiz questions as cards
-   **Bookmarks** – Shows bookmarked questions only
-   **Add** – Allows users to create new quiz questions (in progress)
-   **Profile** – User information and basic settings

## Key Features

-   Mobile-first, component-based layout
-   Semantic HTML and accessibility-focused markup
-   Bookmark and answer toggle interactions
-   Dynamic UI state changes via CSS classes
-   Form handling with validation and live character counters
-   Dynamic creation of quiz cards using JavaScript
-   Clean project structure with reusable CSS components

## Technical Focus

-   **HTML**: semantic structure, accessibility best practices
-   **CSS**: BEM methodology, modular components, global styles
-   **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, event handling, form logic
-   **Workflow**: feature branches, incremental development
-   **Deployment**: GitHub Pages
